# Desktop-Assistant-Project
Desktop Assistant

I have chosen to make the desktop assistant project because makes things easier and faster to do on your device with simple verbal commands.  It is beneficial to the society as it is always available 24/7 when we need it,  helps organize the tasks hence improves the productivity.

My project has many functionalities for exmaple:- Opening Calculator, Google Chrome, YouTube, Gmail and Camera. My app also has a help button in case the user needs guidance.

It comes in very handy especially if one is multitasking as we can give commands to the computer without being distracted.
